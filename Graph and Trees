# Graph Terminology

1. Graph: an abstract network consists of nodes(vertices), connected by edges(arcs). A graph is a pair of sets
G = (V, E).
2. Directed Graph: edges are ordered. An edge E(u,v) is a directed line from u to v. A directed graph can have 
antiparallel edges between a and d(edges going both ways). Parallel edges(both from a to b) are not allowed.
3. self-loop: A node have a edge links to itself. Not allowed in an undirected graph, but possible in a digraph.
Convention is to disallow it.
